Charity Funding Predictor

Overview: The goal of this project is to create an algorithm using machine learning and by neural networks to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by the fictional non-profit foundating, Alphabet Soup.


Results:

	Data Processing:
	What variables are the targets for your model?
		The targets for my model were

	What variable(s) are the features for your model?
		The features for my model were

	What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
		The variables I removed from the input data were because


	Compiling, training and evalutating:
	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
		
	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
		
	What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
